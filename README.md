# Project Title : Mini OS for Machine Learning and Trainig Datasets
This project aims to build a lightweight, browser-accessible notebook platform — similar to Google Colab — that allows users to:

Write and execute Python code (including ML/DL models)

Upload and work with datasets

Visualize training metrics

Save and resume sessions

Run code safely inside Docker containers

Designed for learners, researchers, and developers, the platform enables secure code execution, integrated machine learning environments, and notebook-based collaboration — all without installing anything locally.

Key Features

Notebook-style interface with code & markdown cells

File upload and dataset handling

Execution via Docker-based sandbox (safe environment)

Pre-installed ML/DL libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)

Ready-made template notebooks (CNN, regression, etc.)

Session manager for saving and resuming work

Real-time training visualization (accuracy, loss plots)

GPU simulation support for scalable testing
